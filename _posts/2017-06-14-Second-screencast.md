# Animated pathway visualizations!

Comparing multiple strains and datasets on metabolic pathways can be tricky.
That is why we have added animations to our interactive pathway [app](https://app.dd-decaf.eu/app/pathwayvis).
To check out this new feature, watch first our newest screencast (featuring Danny) and then try out our latest release of the DD-DeCaF platform yourself at [https://app.dd-decaf.eu](https://app.dd-decaf.eu).

The new release also features a revamped user interface for our production pathway [app](https://app.dd-decaf.eu/app/pathways) and an update to [Escher](escher.github.io) v1.6.0 (toolips!).
Next stop interactive strain design. Please send us feedback and suggestions via [twitter](https://twitter.com/dddecaf) or [email](mailto:niso@biosustain.dtu.dk)!
