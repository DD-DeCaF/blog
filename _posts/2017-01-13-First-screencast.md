# Interactive metabolic pathways on DD-DeCaF!

Designing cell factories using
[metabolic flux modeling](http://msb.embopress.org/content/5/1/320.short)
is a [proven](http://www.genomatica.com/products/genobdoprocess/)
[approach](http://farnesene.net/).

Sadly, doing modeling in practice
can be quite tricky, largely due to the lack of flexible and
easy-to-use software solutions.

To fix this, we have started to build
the DD-DeCaF platform which aims to bring both basic and advanced
metabolic flux modeling tools to everyone's fingertips.

We just made a
small screencast to present the latest feature additions, check it
out!
